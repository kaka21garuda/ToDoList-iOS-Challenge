# ToDoList-iOS-Challenge

Features:

* Table view controller to display a list of ToDo items
* Each ToDo item should have a title and a deadline that is displayed on each cell
* The user should be able to toggle the status of a ToDo item (i.e. marking it as done/undone) by tapping a button on the cell
* The user should be able to add a new ToDo item to the list by providing the title and deadline in a dedicated view controller; this view controller should displayed with a modal segue (select Present modally in Storyboard)
* The user can check the details of a ToDo item on a dedicated view controller; this view controller should be displayed with a Push segue (select Show (e.g. Push) in Storyboard), note that a UINavigationController is required for this
* On that view controller, the user should again be able to toggle the status of the ToDo item and also be able to delete it from the list


This challenge is also meant for me to practice Protocol Oriented Programming in Swift.
